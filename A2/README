This is my assignment 2 for cpsc 587 Blender animation
Models to use:
A cylinder for a chalk, cube for black board eraser and a plane for the black board

Camera will be stationary no movement though actors will come on and off the screen
Secondary action may be the board moving in the background when an action is taken on it.
