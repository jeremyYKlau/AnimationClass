Equations that will be used
UPPERCASE = Variables
lowercase = subscripts

F = MA //Newton's law
Fab = -Fba //Net sum of force equals zero a closed system
Fs = -K(X-Xo) //Spring force however this will never stop moving so we require a damping force
Fd = -BV //Damping force
Ft = Fs + Fd ( + Fg if you want gravity) //total force

Normaldamped won't converge to 0 spring force
Underdamped will converge to 0 for spring force eventually
Criticallydamped is when the spring converges to 0 force as soon as possible without any oscilation
AVOID Overdamped it will look weird goes to 0
Aim for underdamped

Part one mass on spring
two points fixed point and a non fixed mass
at every point in simulation we want to get the length of mass to fixed point and compare it to the Xo

Part two chain of springs (rope)
Fixed point and a series of masses
Each mass has a position and velocity (different velocity, all of them probably will have the same mass)
Each mass up the chain holds more mass to the bottom
Tip: Start the chain at an angle to see swinging motion and do the simulation in 2D (use 3d vecs just 0 the z component
Will need an array of pointers
SMass* springs[] {

}

Part three jello cube
Cube with an array of points (subdivide probably into a 3X3 cube)
Connect them all to a single point in the middle
Indexing or another way (TA reccomended) 
Iterate through all points adjacent from a point n, every edge should have a sping at the minimum
Write an algorithm for this one don't do it while creating the program
Will want to drop it or have movement to simulate behavior
Also may want to use smaller time steps for this one or lower height to drop cube from to avoid squishing to a flat line

Part four cloth
Have a large grid of points
Can do it explicitly or iterate with an algorithm could probably use the same one as part three
Fixed points more then one probably the top corners will suffice
However this will create a problem when the connect springs have gravity on them where all the points will fold over and the cloth will just fold over itself
Instead we want diagonal springs (sheering springs) so that when the gravity case happens the cloth won't just fold over and become perfectly flat

Kind of a diagram of how the spring should look between four points (square) of the cloth

NOTE not needed:
You can have other springs extended further to connect other points then adjacent to create a better simulation but further extended springs should have lower influence.
