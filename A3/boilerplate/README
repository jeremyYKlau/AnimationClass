Extension by Jeremy Lau 
Spring mass simulation with all 4 parts

First off the cube is a little off the corners seem to act in strange ways sometimes.
In particular the forward left corner and the back right corner, they fall into the cube.
Second mode switching now works turns out I can just call the create function on button press.
To mode switch:
	1 = Mass spring, just the single moving mass
	2 = Pendulum with springs, pre set at probably should have used for loop to make 
		it more generic
	3 = Cloth, values can be changed by going to switch case for the buttons and 
		changing the value from 5,5 to something else
	4 = Jello Cube, values like cloth can be changed in button switch case. 
		Please don't turn above 5 I think my simulation goes crazy if you do thanks to the constants I made

Side note I added R to reset camera but its choppy don't know why

Complications:
Some complications included never knowing if it was right because it could just be 
hard coded values are wrong or the actual formulas are wrong.
Also float lack of precision caused a large headache as I got 0 cases a lot where the values
ended up as 0 and divided by them causing errors.
Also getting started was the hardest thing took around 4 days but everything else just
went so smoothly after the setting up was done.
