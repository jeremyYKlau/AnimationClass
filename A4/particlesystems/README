arrow down			: rotates camera down
shift+arrow left	: roll camera left

esc					: exit


Notes: 
First bounding box gives strange behavior but after messing with it 
removing bounding lines causes simulation to freeze up sometime so as bad as they are and
as messed up as it makes the boids move they are necessary.
Second press R right at the start to load the values for some reason the values don't start 
initialized from the file they use some random values I had in there from testing.
Third there isn't any extra stuff just somewhat working behaviors and file input honestly just using
the cuspy file input and reading system from assignment 1. Full credit to the cuspy system for that.
