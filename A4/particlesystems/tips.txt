//Possibly add orientation to class

for each boid consider all boids around it 
	
	for avoidance: find average position of all boids in radius, determine avoidance heading by negating the 
		average - alternatively weight normalized vectors based on how close they are
	
	for follow: calculate the average position of all boids(in radius) and set that to the boids heading
	
	for velocity matching: take average velocity of all boids(in radius), take that vector and get our current 
		velocity, and subtract the new one from the current to get our heading. h = acH + fcH + acV
